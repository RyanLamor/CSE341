Welcome to the Contacts management tool, we have two databases of Contacts: Salesforce and Dynamics. Using the buttons on the main page you can view the contents of the database, modify contacts through the use of the ID for the contact and add new contacts. I am doing something similar to this for my job. We have business contacts in an old system (Dynamics) and have recently ported them all to Salesforce a new software platform. I am using SQL to verify that all the contacts ported correctly. I ran out of time to implement an inner join that would return all the contacts that matched in both databases but I think this is enough for most of the requirements for the project. You can also see in my db file the SQL command for the join.
