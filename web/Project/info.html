      <h1>Rain Drop Racing</h2>
      <p>Have you ever been driving in the rain and watched two
         raindrops fall down the window and tried to guess which
         raindrop would get to the bottom first?
         This is the basic idea of this mobile game, but you are
         the raindrop and you are racing other raindrops. As you
         collect water while falling, you fall faster. There are
         powerups to help you and obstacles to avoid, with different
         maps and levels of difficulty to keep things interesting. The
         hope is that this game will actually be developed for Apple users
         by the end of the year. (Android to come later)</p>
      <h1>The Purpose of this Website</h1>
      <p>The main purpose of this website was to design the foundation
         of the database needed to store the data for users, maps, games
         played, etc. for the RainDrop Racing Game. Although there is no
         way to actually play the game on this website, there lies the ability
         to play randomly generated, simulated games. This fulfills the
         scope of CSE 341 as it allows the creation, inserting, updating and
         retrieving of data from a database.
